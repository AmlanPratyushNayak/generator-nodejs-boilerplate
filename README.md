# generator-noderplate

> Generate Node.js starter files with just one command!

We have deployed a npm package that will generate a boilerplate for nodejs backend development. The boilerplate contains code files & folders, that are common in almost all nodejs projects.

## Tools and Technologies used

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [YEOMAN](https://yeoman.io/)

## Usage

You have to first install two of the below mentioned npm packages globally in order to use our package.

1. ``npm install -g yo``
2. ``npm install -g generator-nodejs-boilerplate``

Now, you have to just enter the below command in every node project you are going to build.
- ``yo required-nodejs-files``

> View our npm package [here]().

## Compiles and hot-reloads for development
Once the boilerplate has been generated enter the below command to view your server running locally at a certain port:
```
npm start
```

> If you have any problems, view this [video]() that properly walks you through the installation process.
